# IFF (If and Only If) â‡”

_In logic and related fields such as mathematics and philosophy, if and only if (shortened iff) is a biconditional logical connective between statements._ (Wikipedia) :metal:

IFF is an online "get to do" list rather than a to-do list. You get to do a thing _**if and only if**_ you complete the task or tasks you need to do.

## Project Overview

Traditional to-do lists are typically comprised of unpleasant tasks or chores that need to be done, with no system of rewards. [Studies](https://lifehacker.com/beat-procrastination-with-temptation-bundling-1781175382) [have](http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~kmilkman/2013_Mgmt_Sci.pdf) [shown](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170927-a-unique-way-to-get-work-done) that temptation bundling, or coupling an unpleasant task with a reward, is a more effective way to get things done. IFF will allow users to combine pleasant and unpleasant tasks, and use social accountability as a motivating tool.

The IFF website will allow users to create an account, in which they will be able to store multiple "get-to-do" lists. Each list will have one get-to-do task and one or more to-do tasks. As the to-do tasks are checked off, the get-to-do task becomes available.

**Example list:**

I get to: 
- [ ] play Xbox for one hour

IFF I: 
- [ ] clean the garage
- [x] send the final proposal to my boss
- [ ] work on my app for one hour

IFF will use Django in the backend to store user accounts and user lists. It will use VueJS in the frontend to display each list and provide basic functionality.

**Core technologies:**
- Django backend
- PostgreSQL for the user and list database
- VueJS frontend
- Materialize CSS for style
- Deploy on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

**Potential users**:

- Employees with set daily tasks
- Anyone who needs to do chores at home
- People trying to get in shape/lose weight can reward themselves for going to the gym, etc.
- Parents who want to give their kids incentives to do their chores
- Anyone who currently uses a to-do list app

**Monetization**: While the app will be launched as a free service initially, future monetization is possible via the following:

- Paid account levels with additional features: 
    - Free accounts can be capped at ~10 lists at a time, while monthly subscribers get unlimited lists and possible additional features such as shared lists.
- Paid iOS/Android app:
    - Future iOS/Android versions can be downloaded from app stores for a fee
    
## Functionality
The user starts on the landing page, which will look like so:

![Image of landing page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PdxCodeGuild/20180116-FullStack-Day/32fb93dacbb08965f67cddb6c3ed06fc6ba41625/Code/Anna/Capstone/mockup/img/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-21%20at%2015.33.26.png)

A user signs up, and creates their first IFF list. They enter one get-to-do and how ever many to-dos they want.

Once a user has an account, their home screen shows a list of all of their IFF lists. If they click on one, they go to a detail page where they can see all their to-do items and can check them off. If all of a get-to-do's to-do items are checked off, they get a message saying they can now do their reward task, and the whole list disappears.

Users can also have a history (archive) of all of the things they've done and have gotten to do in the past.

## Data Model

There are three main data models:
1. User
    - One-to-One relationship with Django User model, + extra fields
    - Name
    - username
    - is_new_user? boolean - if true, get welcome screen
    - email (not shown)
    - password (not shown)
    - profile pic ImageField
    - short bio (300 chars)
    - goals (where the user adds their top goals - 300 chars)
    - friends (for future versions when users can share lists with friends)

2. List of IFF Tasks
    - text of one get to do item
    - can you do the get-to-do? boolean
    - is the get-to-do completed? boolean
    - user id of owner of list
    - created date (for sorting)
    - completed date
    - is the whole list completed? boolean (for archiving)
        
3. Individual IFF to-do task
    - text of task
    - foreign key to IFFlist task is part of
    - is it completed? boolean

The User model includes the user's login information, a profile picture, and all of their active and archived IFF lists. Future versions of IFF will add a social media aspect to the user profile, connecting users as friends and letting them see each others' IFF lists and even keep each other accountable by verifying that the to-do tasks were in fact completed (via photo or something like that).

The IFF Task model is just one get-to-do item followed by at least one to-do item. Each new task is an instance of the IFF model.

### Views

    - Register modal
    - Login sidebar
2. New user welcome page with first IFFlist
    - User profile completion sidebar on right
3. Add IFFlist page
    - Current/past lists sidebar on left
4. Detail view for IFFlist
